## _Code examples_

I chose **slider 1C**, and **comic book browser 2B & 3C**, because they were frontend focused and I already got inspired by reading them.

## About

Comic book browser I used Vite sake of easiness to make ready React scaffolding and quick buildup time, and I wasnt used that before so wanted to use this chance to litle bit learn it. With carousel/browser, I used ready (new to me though) plugin because its 2023 in the end, plugin selection is so wide that I didnt see any reason to make it fully by myself, reinventing wheel in modern software development is silly and time-consuming.

Darkmode I made with Context Api because thats _de facto_ way in making theming/dark mode changes, and it served well component based structure in the app.
